%% Callbacks
%% ===================================================================

%% This callback is called at the worker side, when a new request has arrived.
%% You must supply an inmediate response.
%% If you are going to spend more than a few miliseconds and don't want to block
%% the network channel, can return 'defer' and call nkcluster_jobs:reply/2 at a
%% later time. However, you should consider using a task instead.
%% You should only use the {error, term()} form for class-wide errors, not specific
%% problems using this specific request (use {reply, {error, ...}} or similar).
-callback request(nkcluster:request(), from()) ->
    {reply, nkcluster:reply()} | {error, term()} | defer.
 


%% This callback is called at the worker side, when a new task is requested to start.
%% You should start a new Erlang process and return its pid(), and, optionally,
%% a reply to send back to the caller.
%% You must return {error, term()} if you couldn't start the process.
%% NkCLUSTER will send an event {nkcluster, {task_started, TaskId}} to the class.
%% When the process ends, an event {nkcluster, {task_stopped, Reason, TaskId}}
%% will be sent.
-callback task(nkcluster:task_id(), nkcluster:task()) ->
    {ok, pid()} | {ok, nkcluster:reply(), pid()} | {error, term()}.


%% This callback is called at the worker side, when a command is sent to a
%% currenly running task. The pid() of the task is included.
%% You must supply and inmediate response.
%% If you are going to spend more than a few miliseconds and don't want to block
%% the network channel, can return 'defer' and call nkcluster_jobs:reply/2 at a
%% later time. However, you should consider using events instead.
%% You should only use the {error, term()} form for class-wide errors, not specific
%% problems using this specific request (use {reply, {error, ...}} or similar).
-callback command(pid(), nkcluster:command(), from()) ->
    {reply, nkcluster:reply()} | {error, term()} | defer.


%% This callback is called at the worker side, for each started task,
%% when the node status changes.
%% If the status changes to stopping, the task should stop as soon as possible,
%% in order to shut down the node.
-callback status(pid(), nkcluster:node_status()) ->
    ok.


%% This callback is called at the control side, when an event is sent from
%% a task or request at the worker side.
%% NkCLUSTER will also sent the following events:
%%
%% - {nkcluster, {task_started, TaskId}
%%   Called when a new task has started at the remote node
%%
%% - {nkcluster, {task_stopped, TaskId, Reason}}
%%   Called when a task has stopped at the remote node
%%
%% - {nkcluster, connection_error}
%%	 It means that the communication channel has failed, and some events could
%%   have been lost. You should try to recover the state from the worker node
%%   sending requests to it.

-callback event(nkcluster:node_id(), term()) ->
    ok.
